Though no claim of responsibility was made, the attack is widely believed to have been carried out by the armed Basque separatist group ETA.==Background==The Rolando Cafe was located on 4 Calle del Correo in Madrid, close to the General Directorate of Security, the headquarters of the Spanish Police. It was regularly frequented by members of the police force and security services.==The attack==The bomb was placed at the entrance to the building and exploded on a Friday afternoon, during a busy lunchtime period. More than 300 people were eating in the neighbouring El Tobogan restaurant at the time of the explosion, two of whom were among the dead. The explosion caused significant damage to nearby buildings, shattering the windows of the nearby General Directorate of Security, while two cars parked nearby were totally destroyed. The bomb caused part of the Rolando Cafe's ceiling to collapse and guests staying in a pension above were injured due to falling through the gaps in the ceiling. The police immediately arrived and cordoned off the scene.Two of the 12 initially killed and 11 of the injured were members of the police force. However the wounded included the number two of the Spanish Political Police, with the remainder employees and customers of the cafe. A thirteenth victim died in 1977 of injuries suffered during the attack.==Responses and arrests==The leadership of ETA was taken aback by the responses to the attack and on 15 September, issued a statement denying their responsibility, though implicitly defending the bombing, claiming that the cafe was full of police agents. This caused tensions within the group, with some members believing that the organisation had to admit responsibility for attacks carried out, even if the results were not those intended. The bombing gave those opposed to further liberalisation of the country, such as Blas Pi\u00f1ar, the opportunity to attack the Prime Minister Carlos Arias Navarro.In the immediate period of confusion following the attack, some blamed the attack on the far-right. The police, however, concluded that ETA were responsible and launched an operation against the group's infrastructure in Madrid. Initially the police also blamed the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) of cooperating in the attack, but the PCE energetically denied involvement. Reports that police officers had received a circular advising them not to go to the Rolando Cafe or stand outside the building added to the mystery surrounding the incident.Leftists known to be sympathetic to ETA were arrested, including Eva Forest, wife of the communist playwright Alfonso Sastre, Mari Luz Fernandez and her relatives, Lidia Falc\u00f3n, the theatre director Vicente Sainz de la Pe\u00f1a, construction worker Antonio Dur\u00e1n, pilot Bernardo Badell and his wife Mar\u00eda del Carmen Nadal, the actress Mar\u00eda Paz Ballesteros, and the writer Eliseo Bayo. Between June 1975 and February 1976, courts dismissed the cases and released the defendants. However Eva Forest and Mari Luz Fernandez remained in prison as they were charged with complicity in the assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco one year before. However, neither Forest nor Luz Fernandez were tried for the Rolando bombing, as they were released in June 1977 as part of a general amnesty for political prisoners. In 1981 Lidia Falc\u00f3n published a denunciation of Eva Forest which suggested that Forest's role in the Rolando attack had been considerable.The government also offered a reward of one million pesetas for information leading to the capture of Juan Manuel Galarraga Mendizabal who they suspected of being a high ranking ETA figure involved in the bombing.

Though no claim of responsibility was made, the attack is widely believed to have been carried out by the armed Basque separatist group ETA.==Background==The Rolando Cafe was located on 4 Calle del Correo in Madrid, close to the General Directorate of Security, the headquarters of the Spanish Police. It was regularly frequented by members of the police force and security services.==The attack==The bomb was placed at the entrance to the building and exploded on a Friday afternoon, during a busy lunchtime period. More than 300 people were eating in the neighbouring El Tobogan restaurant at the time of the explosion, two of whom were among the dead. The explosion caused significant damage to nearby buildings, shattering the windows of the nearby General Directorate of Security, while two cars parked nearby were totally destroyed. The bomb caused part of the Rolando Cafe's ceiling to collapse and guests staying in a pension above were injured due to falling through the gaps in the ceiling. The police immediately arrived and cordoned off the scene.Two of the 12 initially killed and 11 of the injured were members of the police force. However the wounded included the number two of the Spanish Political Police, with the remainder employees and customers of the cafe. A thirteenth victim died in 1977 of injuries suffered during the attack.==Responses and arrests==The leadership of ETA was taken aback by the responses to the attack and on 15 September, issued a statement denying their responsibility, though implicitly defending the bombing, claiming that the cafe was full of police agents. This caused tensions within the group, with some members believing that the organisation had to admit responsibility for attacks carried out, even if the results were not those intended. The bombing gave those opposed to further liberalisation of the country, such as Blas Pi\u00f1ar, the opportunity to attack the Prime Minister Carlos Arias Navarro.In the immediate period of confusion following the attack, some blamed the attack on the far-right. The police, however, concluded that ETA were responsible and launched an operation against the group's infrastructure in Madrid. Initially the police also blamed the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) of cooperating in the attack, but the PCE energetically denied involvement.

The police immediately arrived and cordoned off the scene.Two of the 12 initially killed and 11 of the injured were members of the police force. However the wounded included the number two of the Spanish Political Police, with the remainder employees and customers of the cafe. A thirteenth victim died in 1977 of injuries suffered during the attack.==Responses and arrests==The leadership of ETA was taken aback by the responses to the attack and on 15 September, issued a statement denying their responsibility, though implicitly defending the bombing, claiming that the cafe was full of police agents. This caused tensions within the group, with some members believing that the organisation had to admit responsibility for attacks carried out, even if the results were not those intended. The bombing gave those opposed to further liberalisation of the country, such as Blas Pi\u00f1ar, the opportunity to attack the Prime Minister Carlos Arias Navarro.In the immediate period of confusion following the attack, some blamed the attack on the far-right. The police, however, concluded that ETA were responsible and launched an operation against the group's infrastructure in Madrid. Initially the police also blamed the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) of cooperating in the attack, but the PCE energetically denied involvement. Reports that police officers had received a circular advising them not to go to the Rolando Cafe or stand outside the building added to the mystery surrounding the incident.Leftists known to be sympathetic to ETA were arrested, including Eva Forest, wife of the communist playwright Alfonso Sastre, Mari Luz Fernandez and her relatives, Lidia Falc\u00f3n, the theatre director Vicente Sainz de la Pe\u00f1a, construction worker Antonio Dur\u00e1n, pilot Bernardo Badell and his wife Mar\u00eda del Carmen Nadal, the actress Mar\u00eda Paz Ballesteros, and the writer Eliseo Bayo. Between June 1975 and February 1976, courts dismissed the cases and released the defendants. However Eva Forest and Mari Luz Fernandez remained in prison as they were charged with complicity in the assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco one year before. However, neither Forest nor Luz Fernandez were tried for the Rolando bombing, as they were released in June 1977 as part of a general amnesty for political prisoners. In 1981 Lidia Falc\u00f3n published a denunciation of Eva Forest which suggested that Forest's role in the Rolando attack had been considerable.The government also offered a reward of one million pesetas for information leading to the capture of Juan Manuel Galarraga Mendizabal who they suspected of being a high ranking ETA figure involved in the bombing.

Ahmad Khan Rahami, a U.S. citizen of Afghan descent has been charged in the bombing.Multiple federal chargesThe details are contained in criminal complaints made public Tuesday spelling out multiple federal charges against 28-year-old Ahmad Khan Rahami. Most of the charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.Authorities arrested Rahami on Monday after an exchange of gunfire with police that left him and two officers wounded.According to the court documents, investigators believe Rahami used an eBay account with the username \"ahmad rahimi\" to buy citric acid, a circuit board, electric igniters and hundreds of ball bearings between June 20 and August 10. The items were shipped to a business in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, where Rahami worked until September 12.Ball bearings were found in two pressure cooker bombs placed four blocks apart in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York late Saturday. One of them exploded, injuring 29 people, while the other was recovered intact. Investigators said the second bomb had \"numerous\" electric igniters.That second device was tested for fingerprints, and the criminal complaint said all 12 prints found were matches for Rahami. The documents say his prints were also found on items inside of a backpack that was discovered late Sunday at a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey, just outside of New York. The bag contained multiple explosive devices, including one that blew up as police tried to disarm it with a robot.Authorities also tied Rahami to a bomb that blew up in a trash can in Seaside Park, New Jersey, early Saturday.That link involved one of the cell phones that investigators said were shipped last year to a store in Perth Amboy near the address that Rahami provided as his home in a 2012 passport application. They said a second phone shipped to the same place was used in the bomb that blew up in Chelsea.A third phone, one found with the other Chelsea bomb, was once registered to one of Rahami's family members, the documents said.A still image captured from a video from WABC television shows New York bombing suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami being loaded into an ambulance after a shoot-out with police in Linden, New Jersey, Sept. 19, 2016.Surveillance videoInvestigators also said they used surveillance video to tie Rahami to the Chelsea bombs, with cameras putting him near the explosion site about 37 minutes before the blast and near where the other bomb was found two minutes after the first one went off.

militant groups in recent years from Iraq to Israel and Afghanistan and Russia.But until Monday at the Boston Marathon finish line in Copley Square, such street-level bombings targeting sidewalk or marketplace crowds had not taken place on American soil.US law enforcement and intelligence officials across the country and overseas, scrambling to identify the source of the explosives, are now worried that the marathon sidewalk bombing could mark a new chapter in the struggle to secure the American homeland.Advertisement\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this around the world, but what is so concerning about this is that it hadn\u2019t happened here, not like this.Until yesterday,\u2019\u2019 said a senior homeland security official in Washington.The Boston bombs were packed into pressure cookers and hidden in backpacks or duffel bags, according to multiple press accounts citing unidentified sources, another similarity with some Mideast attacks using \u201cimprovised explosive devices,\u2019\u2019 or IEDs.One of the bombs used in a foiled attack in New York\u2019s Times Square in 2010 was fashioned from a pressure cooker.A joint warning issued by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security in 2010 said pressure cookers has been used for bombs in multiple attacks in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Nepal.Reports from medical staff at Boston hospitals who treated victims in the marathon attack indicate the bombs in this case were packed with BB\u2019s, nails, and other projectiles intended to maximize human carnage.That contrasts with the large truck bombs that were used in Oklahoma City in 1995 and in the garage of the World Trade Center North Tower in 1993, which were intended to inflict damage on buildings, as well as people.IED\u2019s pack a much

Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers threw a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974.==The bombing==The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey. The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9:20, injuring 23 civilians and 10 off-duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the injuries were very serious, with at least three soldiers losing limbs. The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign (Phase Two) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government. The next day, the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street, injuring several people.==Aftermath==One of the police officers in charge of the investigation into the bombing described it as a \"carbon copy\" of the Guildford pub bombings in October 1974 for which four people were already serving their sentences. The cell's campaign would continue until December 1975 when they were caught at the siege of Balcombe Street. The unit would eventually end up planting close to 50 bombs in London and elsewhere in southern England and carrying out several shootings which, along with the bombings, caused the deaths of nearly 20 people, injured hundreds and caused millions of pounds worth of damage to property.==See also==*Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions (1970\u201379)== References ==", "question": "What was the device that was detonated?", "answer": "bomb", "explanation": ["What was manufactured? bomb", "who assembled #1?

He concluded that states have an obligation to launch inquiries into cases in which civilians become caught up.His report said: \"Having regard to the duty of states to protect civilians in armed conflict, the special rapporteur concluded that in any case in which there have been, or appear to have been, civilian casualties that were not anticipated when the attack was planned, the state responsible is under an obligation to conduct a prompt, independent and impartial fact-finding inquiry and to provide a detailed public explanation of the results.\"This obligation would be triggered whenever there is a plausible indication from any apparently reliable source that unintended civilian casualties may have been sustained.\"The proposal is likely to form the basis for a draft resolution to be debated by the UNHRC in Geneva, Switzerland.Emmerson devoted a large part of the report to listing specific drone strikes involving civilians. He said he had identified 30 attacks out of a total of 37 brought to his attention in which civilians had been killed, suffered life-threatening injuries or been put at risk.In Afghanistan, Emmerson, who travelled widely for the report, said that up to the end of 2012 drone strikes \"appeared to have inflicted significantly lower levels of civilians casualties than aerial attacks carried out by other air platforms. This is no longer the position.\"In 2013, drone attacks accounted for 40% of the total number of civilian fatalities from air strikes. There were 45 civilian fatalities and 14 non-fatal injuries, a threefold increase compared with 2012.In Pakistan, he recorded \"a marked drop\" in civilian casualties since 2012. \"Figures to the end of 2013 confirm that there has been a significant de-escalation in the number of recorded drone strikes in Pakistan,\" he said. Strikes were down to 27 in 2013 from a peak of 128 in 2010, and for the first time in nine years there had been no civilian casualties reported.\"At the time of writing, there have been no reported drone strikes during 2014, the longest pause since President Obama took office,\" Emmerson said.The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which monitors media reports on drones strikes, reported last month that there had been no known drone strikes in Pakistan since 25 December. US officials say the lull was a response to requests by the Pakistani government, which has been trying to launch peace talks with the Pakistani Taliban.In Yemen, Emmerson was told that the US routinely sought prior consent for attacks, although Human Rights Watch has quoted the Yemeni government as saying they were not pre-approved.In Israel, he said the government stressed it aimed for zero civilian casualties, saying it provided advance warning of attacks where possible. But Emmerson \"identified a number of sample strikes in which there are credible allegations that civilians were killed or injured as the result of Israeli drone strikes in Gaza\".Kat Craig, legal director of Reprieve, the legal charity which has been campaigning on the issue, said: \"In Yemen, Pakistan and elsewhere, the US, assisted by its European allies, is carrying out devastating attacks with total impunity \u2013 a practice that is terrorising local communities, and creating far more extremism than it has ever eliminated.\"It is high time that the US provided full accountability and transparency around its use of drones, and investigated civilian casualties.

After the explosion, the interior minister, Christophe Castaner, sent instructions for Lyon authorities to strengthen security for \u201cpublic sites and sporting, cultural and religious events\u201d.On Victor Hugo street, police removed the cordon around the explosion area and the atmosphere on Saturday was almost back to normal, with people doing their shopping \u2013 the only oddity being the chalk lines drawn by forensics on the ground.\u201cIt was scary,\u201d said Gisele Sanchez, owner of a haberdashery close to the bakery. Large wood planks covered her shop window, which was damaged by the blast. Police found in her shop screws, metallic balls and batteries believed to be from the device, yet Sanchez was able to reopen on Saturday morning.France is jittery over a spate of attacks in recent years, some of them deadly, carried out by people ranging from extremist attackers to mentally unstable individuals.

Salameh, the \ufb01rst suspect arrested in the bombing, investigators discovered a jumble of chemicals, chemistry implements and detonating materials stacked in a storage locker at 69 Mallory Avenue in Jersey City that they say may also have served as the bomb laboratory.The day before the explosion that killed at least \ufb01ve people and injured more than 1,000 others, Mr.Salameh and several other men made \"numerous trips\" to the locker, which Mr.Salameh had rented for $97 a month late last year, the authorities say.The suspects traveled in a yellow Ford van, the investigators say, which has been identi\ufb01ed as the vehicle that carried the explosive into the underground garage of the World Trade Center.A Thick PasteThe investigators and experts say that after mixing the three main chemicals -- nitric and sulfuric acids and urea, a common ingredient in fertilizers -- into a thick paste, the bombers are believed to have packed the material into half a dozen or so cardboard boxes.They simply loaded the boxes loosely into the van, without using a special container for them, the investigators believe, and drove across the Hudson River to the trade center.The bombers ignited their concoction, investigators believe, with several smaller nitroglycerine bombs, which themselves were touched off with the kind of blasting cap routinely used at construction and mining sites across the country.The blasting cap is the only ingredient in the deadly mix, the experts and law-enforcement of\ufb01cials say, that requires a license or permit for purchase, and most probably was stolen.Manuals Were FoundThe investigators said they found manuals for bomb making in one of the apartments that they raided after arresting Mr.Salameh.Neil C.Livingstone, the president of the Institute on Terrorism and Sub-National Con\ufb02ict in Washington, said that as a test of how easy it was to obtain such guides to destruction, he recently wrote to a publishing house using a child's lined notepad and a crayon.Three of the bomb-making manuals were promptly delivered to the address Mr. Livingstone had given, he said, no questions asked.Though building the bomb was relatively easy, the experts say, it was not by any means free of danger.The bulkiest part of the bomb, they say, was extremely stable and could only have been touched off with a tremendous kick, like that provided by nitroglycerine.Making the nitroglycerine, by blending some of the chemicals, was the trickiest part of the process.As the chemicals are mixed to form this compound, said Dr. Per-Anders Persson, the director of the center for explosives research at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, they get hot and may explode.Often, he said, beakers are packed in dry ice to keep the chemicals at a safe temperature.A Dangerous MixThe nitroglycerine could have also exploded prematurely with any jolt or sharp change in temperature, the experts said.The bombers risked blowing themselves up as well, the experts said, when they hooked up the wires connecting the bomb's trigger with the blasting cap.Dr.Robert H. Kupperman, a senior adviser for science and technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies at Georgetown University, said that perhaps the greatest skill in making the bomb came in rigging the chain of triggering explosives so they all tore into the bulk of the bomb for maximum effect, as investigators at the World Trade Center say apparently happened.So far, in more than a week of searching, they have not found a single grain of the main explosive material.Sulfuric Acid Widely SoldWilliam Lazor, a senior technical consultant at the Du Pont Company in Wilmington, Del., said that sulfuric acid is the most widely sold chemical in the United States, used in the manufacture of everything from battery acid to detergents and shampoos.Dale Ladysh, another consultant at Du Pont, said that nitric acid is only slightly behind in popularity.It is used, he said, in the electronics industry and for making stainless steel and many industrial dies and pigmentations.Both acids are commonly used metal cleaners.According to Rick Amberg of Amberg Perennial Farm and Garden Center in West\ufb01eld, N.J., urea is often scattered over lawns to make them grow lustrously, and is also used in making plastics.Mr. Amberg sells a plastic 50-pound bag of urea for $20.99.In Newark, the Dooner & Smith Chemical Company sells a 15-gallon drum of sulfuric acid, weighing 172 pounds, for $41.28.The same size container of nitric acid costs $44 and weighs 220 pounds.\"Whoever put that thing together really intended to do a lot of damage,\" said Mr.Roy.\"This kind of explosive device is often used to fracture and move rock.It expands slowly with great force.\"", "question": "What are chemicals components used for when manufacturing, assembling, or producing something?", "answer": "chemicals", "explanation": ["What event contains chemicals is the Components? mixing@349", "What event is overlaps #1 has a Components? mixing@349", "manufactured or assembled or produced from what components in the #2? chemicals"], "relation": "overlaps", "events": [{"id": "JC002YBW2-E13", "event_type": "ArtifactExistence.ManufactureAssemble.Unspecified", "trigger": {"start": 349, "end": 350, "text": "mixing", "sent_idx": 13}, "arguments": [{"entity_id": "JC002YBW2-T114", "role": "Components", "text": "chemicals"}]}, {"id": "JC002YBW2-E13", "event_type": "ArtifactExistence.ManufactureAssemble.Unspecified", "trigger": {"start": 349, "end": 350, "text": "mixing", "sent_idx": 13}, "arguments": [{"entity_id": "JC002YBW2-T114", "role": "Components", "text": "chemicals"}]}]}, {"example_id": "train_68_s1_1", "context": "THE TWIN TOWERS; Deadly Bomb Was Cheap and Easily Made, Experts SayThe bomb that savaged the World Trade Center, investigators and explosive experts said yesterday, apparently was put together with ordinary chemicals that are widely and cheaply available at chemical supply houses and gardening centers throughout the country.Experts now estimate that the bomb weighed about 1,000 pounds and that the chemicals to make it were bought for a little more than $400.Though a young chemical engineer was arrested yesterday in connection with the explosion, the experts say that such a bomb could have been made by almost anyone with the help of one of scores of manuals, obtainable in bookstores and libraries, that provide step-by-step instructions.\"It's very easy to make one of these things,\" said Edward M.Roy, an explosives expert at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro, N.M. \"I tell my students, a lot of explosives I can make in my wastebasket.\"A Jumble of ChemicalsFollowing the trail of Mohammed A.

Kupperman, a senior adviser for science and technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies at Georgetown University, said that perhaps the greatest skill in making the bomb came in rigging the chain of triggering explosives so they all tore into the bulk of the bomb for maximum effect, as investigators at the World Trade Center say apparently happened.So far, in more than a week of searching, they have not found a single grain of the main explosive material.Sulfuric Acid Widely SoldWilliam Lazor, a senior technical consultant at the Du Pont Company in Wilmington, Del., said that sulfuric acid is the most widely sold chemical in the United States, used in the manufacture of everything from battery acid to detergents and shampoos.Dale Ladysh, another consultant at Du Pont, said that nitric acid is only slightly behind in popularity.It is used, he said, in the electronics industry and for making stainless steel and many industrial dies and pigmentations.Both acids are commonly used metal cleaners.According to Rick Amberg of Amberg Perennial Farm and Garden Center in West\ufb01eld, N.J., urea is often scattered over lawns to make them grow lustrously, and is also used in making plastics.Mr. Amberg sells a plastic 50-pound bag of urea for $20.99.In Newark, the Dooner & Smith Chemical Company sells a 15-gallon drum of sulfuric acid, weighing 172 pounds, for $41.28.The same size container of nitric acid costs $44 and weighs 220 pounds.\"Whoever put that thing together really intended to do a lot of damage,\" said Mr.Roy.\"This kind of explosive device is often used to fracture and move rock.It expands slowly with great force.\"", "question": "What components were used to detonate wires connecting?", "answer": "trigger is a compoents using blasting cap to detonate wires connecting", "explanation": ["what was used to detonate by wires connecting? blasting cap", "what components was manufactured from #1? trigger"], "events": [{"id": "JC002YBW2-E17", "event_type": "Conflict.Attack.DetonateExplode", "trigger": {"start": 442, "end": 444, "text": "touched off", "sent_idx": 15}, "arguments": [{"entity_id": "JC002YBW2-T145", "role": "ExplosiveDevice", "text": "themselves"}, {"entity_id": "JC002YBW2-T134", "role": "Attacker", "text": "The bombers"}, {"entity_id": "JC002YBW2-T159", "role": "Instrument", "text": "blasting cap"}]}, {"id": "JC002YBW2-E26", "event_type": "ArtifactExistence.ManufactureAssemble.Unspecified", "trigger": {"start": 777, "end": 779, "text": "hooked up", "sent_idx": 30}, "arguments": [{"entity_id": "JC002YBW2-T137", "role": "ManufacturerAssembler", "text": "they"}, {"entity_id": "JC002YBW2-T207", "role": "Artifact", "text": "bomb"}, {"entity_id": "JC002YBW2-T208", "role": "Components", "text": "trigger"}, {"entity_id": "JC002YBW2-T209", "role": "Components", "text": "blasting cap"}]}]}, {"example_id": "train_68_s2_13", "context": "THE TWIN TOWERS; Deadly Bomb Was Cheap and Easily Made, Experts SayThe bomb that savaged the World Trade Center, investigators and explosive experts said yesterday, apparently was put together with ordinary chemicals that are widely and cheaply available at chemical supply houses and gardening centers throughout the country.Experts now estimate that the bomb weighed about 1,000 pounds and that the chemicals to make it were bought for a little more than $400.Though a young chemical engineer was arrested yesterday in connection with the explosion, the experts say that such a bomb could have been made by almost anyone with the help of one of scores of manuals, obtainable in bookstores and libraries, that provide step-by-step instructions.\"It's very easy to make one of these things,\" said Edward M.Roy, an explosives expert at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro, N.M. \"I tell my students, a lot of explosives I can make in my wastebasket.\"A Jumble of ChemicalsFollowing the trail of Mohammed A.
